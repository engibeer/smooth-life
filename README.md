Description

Conway's Game of Life is generalized to a continuous domain. OpenGL and GLSL shaders are used for real-time 2D and 3D graphics. Time stepping is done via a real to complex FFT based convolution operation. There are also two deliberately simple test implementations in FreeBasic and Matlab. A 2D version on a sphere shows that it is really not dependent on the underlying grid.
